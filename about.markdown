My name is Kenneth Meyer, I am a 3nd year CSEM student in the Oden Institute at The University of Texas at Austin. In the Oden Insitute, I am working with Dr. Michael Sacks to develop open-source Finite Element software an a modular framework to allow for extension to machine learning-based modeling approaches. In the space of cardiac mechaincs, I mainly focus on heart valves. You can find my profile [here](https://oden.utexas.edu/people/directory/Kenneth-Meyer/).

I obtained my B.S. in Computational Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin, and I grew up in Westfield, NJ. While an undergrad at UT, I was involved with various organizations on campus including Code Orange, Silver Spurs, The Tejas Club, and [Texas Ice Hockey](https://www.texasicehockey.com/). I was also a tutor through the Neighborhood Longhorn Program and the department of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics.
