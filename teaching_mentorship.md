## Mentorship and Teaching

As a 2nd year Ph.D. student, I have never been a TA, but I have had various tutoring and mentoring experiences.

I have taught elementary-aged students how to code using Code.org and Scratch through **Code Orange**, and I have also tutored middle-school aged students in various subjects through my involvement in Silver Spurs and the **Neighborhood Longhorns Program**. I also tutored undergraduates in first and second-year Computational Engineering courses, COE301 and COE311k.

My mentorship experiences include volunteering for **RBI Austin** as a coach for a u12 baseball team, and mentoring an undergraduate mathematics student, Hannah Lee, through the [Directed Reading Program](https://sites.cns.utexas.edu/utgd/directed-reading-program). Her project covered an application of k-means and the theory behind dimensionality reduction techniques (i.e. the Random Projection Theorem/Johnson Lindenstrauss Lemma).
