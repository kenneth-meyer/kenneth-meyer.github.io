## Mentorship and Teaching

As a 3rd year Ph.D. student, I have had various tutoring and mentoring experiences at The University of Texas at Austin. I find joy in them; they are what prevents me from prematurely pivoting my current career route.

### Graduate
#### Fall 2024 - Spring 2025
- Leading a project-based team of four undergraduate students through the Computer Science department's Directed Reading Program. They are focusing on developing an open-source tool for visualizing solutions to Isogeometric Analysis (IGA)-based problems.
- I'm also training a undergraduate to use machine-learning based approaches to solving PDEs using our lab's open-source Finite Element code. We are examining data-driven and PDE residual-based approaches.

#### Summer 2023
- Mentored an undergraduate mathematics student, through the [Directed Reading Program](https://sites.cns.utexas.edu/utgd/directed-reading-program). Project covered an application of k-means and the theory behind dimensionality reduction techniques (i.e. the Random Projection Theorem/Johnson Lindenstrauss Lemma).

### Undergrad
#### Fall 2020 - Spring 2021
- Tutored undergraduates in first and second-year Computational Engineering courses, COE301 and COE311k.
#### Spring 2020
- Tutored middle-school aged students in various subjects through my involvement in Silver Spurs and the **Neighborhood Longhorns Program**. 
#### Fall 2018 - Spring 2020
- Taught elementary-aged students how to code using Code.org and Scratch through **Code Orange**

### Non-academic Mentorship
#### Spring 2025 - Present
- Served as Head coach for the Texas Ice Hockey team in Spring 2025, will be on the staff as an assistant for 2025-2026
#### Summer 2021
- Volunteered for **RBI Austin** as a coach for a u12 baseball team
- Hockey camp counselor for 6-15 year olds at Erik Nates Euro Hockey
