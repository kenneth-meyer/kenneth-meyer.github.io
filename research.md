## Research Experience and Interests

My research interests can be broadly described as computational medicine and machine learning, with a focus on surrogate modeling and dimensionality-reduction approaches to approximating the solution of PDEs. My favorite course I have taken at Oden is either Machine Learning and Data Science or Functional Analysis (shoutout Leszek Demkowicz), and my favorite course as an undergraduate was Advanced Scientific Computing, an advanced linear algebra course that introduced the Finite Element Method.

From experience and from advice from people in the Oden Institute, I believe that writing good software is one of the best things you can do as a researcher. While I won't be showcasing unit tests or CI during my next presentation this summer at [USNCCM18](https://usnccm18.usacm.org/), they are critial in streamlining code development and ensuring that the software we develop is robust and easily extensible. I'm very excited for whenver our lab's extension of JAX-FEM, an open-source finite element code, will be released (we don't want to publish broken code...it's almost there!).
